# Doing-Good

Doing Good is a prototype application created at HackHPI 2019. It allows people in need of help to connect with volunteers via a Tinder-like Interface.

**Setting up the Environment**

To run the application make sure you have react-native installed. If you haven't installed react-native yet follow this tutorial and make sure you use the CLI Quickstart: <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>

Then clone the git repo and navigate into the cloned Folder.

Run `npm install` in that folder. Then you should be able to run the application with `react-native run-android` . Make sure your device is connected and USB-Debugging is enabled or you have your android-emulator up and running.
